####### This application allows users to input text, select source and target languages from a list, and uses the Microsoft Translator API for translation. Users can reverse languages and clear input text. It features a user-friendly, dynamic, and error-handling interface with a simple, responsive UI, implemented in ReactJS.

######### Functionalities/Approach:

This project implements functional components and state management. It uses the Microsoft Translator API for translations, making POST requests with input text and language preferences. The translated text updates the componentâ€™s state, and loading spinners display during the API call. The interface allows users to select languages, input text, translate, and reverse language selection. If the API call fails, an error message is shown.
